# Getting Started

Hi,
This project is a basic setup for a full-stack web application using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MySQL for the database. It serves as a starting point for building more complex applications.

You can clone the repo and have some configuration first before using it

## Installation

After you clone the repo, here is some step

1. In the project directory, you have to run this first:

-   go to frontend side at client folder and run this `cd client && npm i`

-   after that, go to backend side at server folder and run this `cd ../server && npm i`

2. if installation proccess is finish, you can run the app with this:

-   go to client folder and run this `npm start`

-   to run backend, make sure mysql server is running. after that, go to server folder and run this: `node server.js`

## Usage

-   The frontend React application is served on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
-   The backend Node.js server is served on `http://localhost:5000`
-   Modify and expand upon the frontend and backend code to build your application.
